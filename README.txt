This repository is a collection of vim plugins, scripts, etc. that are useful for all kinds of work. Some plugins are maintained as submodules; to update to the latest version, change into the appropriate submodule folder, run git pull, then commit the change.

To use the builtin .vimrc file, either source the file inside your vimrc:

so ~/.vim/.vimrc

or symlink it into your home folder:

ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
